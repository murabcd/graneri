## Status

Graneri is early. Expect bugs.

Desktop is the primary experience. Public desktop builds are not published yet.

## Features

- Live meeting transcription with notes generated as conversations happen
- AI-powered note refinement for cleaner summaries and better structure
- Custom note templates for repeatable meeting formats and workflows
- Workspace organization for keeping teams, notes, and context aligned
- Desktop meeting workflow with quick capture during active calls
- Calendar-aware setup that prepares notes around scheduled meetings

## Built with

- [Vite](https://vite.dev/) and [React](https://react.dev/) for the renderer
- [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/) for the desktop shell
- [Convex](https://www.convex.dev/) for realtime backend functions and data
- [Better Auth](https://www.better-auth.com/) for authentication
- [AI SDK](https://sdk.vercel.ai/docs) with [OpenAI](https://openai.com/) by default
- [Tiptap](https://tiptap.dev/) for rich-text note editing
- [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com), [Radix UI](https://radix-ui.com), and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com) for UI

## Running locally

```bash
bun install
bun run doctor:self-host
bun dev
```

Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` and fill in the Convex, auth, and OpenAI values first.

The web app runs at [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/).

## Desktop

Graneri is desktop-first. For now, build the desktop app from source:

```bash
bun run dist:mac
```

Published desktop builds will come later.

## Self-hosting

Self-hosting requires your own Convex deployment, OAuth apps, and AI provider key. See `.env.example`.

Run this after filling env values:

```bash
bun run doctor:self-host
```

## Project structure

- `apps/web`: browser app and shared renderer
- `apps/desktop`: Electron desktop app
- `apps/marketing`: public marketing site
- `convex`: Convex backend, auth, schema, actions, and HTTP routes
- `packages/platform`: renderer-safe desktop bridge helpers
- `packages/ui`: shared UI primitives

## Model providers

Graneri ships with OpenAI as the default provider. Because the app uses the AI SDK, it can be adapted to other supported providers.
